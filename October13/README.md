### Image Manipulation Assignment
## myDuck


For this assignment I was leaning more towards making something that is interactive. And, I wanted to make something that is simple and cute. I used the technique that Dan Shiffman introduced in his videos, which is manipulating the pixels in an image and allocating them to fill shapes.

My program is basically an interactive duck, that gets angry if you click on its face, and feels loved when you click on its tummy :)

I first started by drawing a duck on my iPad and loading the image in my code. 

Here are the three images I used for this program:

After that it was fairly simple. I used if statements to map the areas of the face and the tummy, so that if the mouse is pressed there then a specific image of the duck will appear.



Here is a GIF of what happens:
