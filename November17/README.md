## 3rd Arduino Assignments

### Project Idea:

For this assignment I had initially thought of attaching an object on a servo motor, and the user would press a button to bang or shake the object, whilst a song is playing. However, through the process of making this project, I came up with another idea.

This project is a mini disco for a dog. The user will first try to make the dog dance, by playing its favorite song (Take On Me by A-Ha), but the dog will not like it, and will twitch/dance angirly when the last note is played. Therefore, the user should then flip the switch, which will play the original song, and then the dog will dance happily. 

The dog is basically a keychain attached to a servo motor. The user will press buttons to play the tune, and the last note is played on a photoresistor (I ran out of buttons). For extra effect, I added my iPad into this, where I used it as a dance floor for the dog.

### New concepts + Problems:

With this project I had come across many issues that allowed me to understand different concepts better. First, I was not aware of the issue of multitasking in arduino and how difficult it may be, and how the delay(); function can affect the whole program. 

I wanted the buzzer, and servo to work at the same time, and mine did not do that. I asked for help on discord, and the Professor suggested I look at examples where one had LEDs and servos working together, and another that had LEDs and a buzzer working together. So, I tried to understand the concepts in both programs, and see how I can replicate it in mine.

Although, it took me about a day and a half to finally get it working, I became more confident in my ability to understand these codes, and I'm so happy that I challanged myself to make this work.

So, my program uses both the servo and the buzzer simultaneously.

Another aspect I am still trying to perfect and understand, is wiring my breadboard. I can't seem to put all the wires in neatly. They're all over the place, and with this project it was chaotic. I guess what I should be doing now is planning ahead of time what components I will be using and sticking to them. If I change my mind afterwards, I will push myself to rearrange the whole breadboard, and not add things on where there is space. Because, with this project the concept was born while I was working on the breadboard, I kept removing and adding components without adjusting their placements. So, I am to blame for this chaos :)
