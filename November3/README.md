## First Arduino Assignment

I finally got my arduino Sunday night, thanks to the professor.

The way I started working on this assignment was really fun. After, getting the gist of how to put my components on the breadboard, I went a little overboard with the assignment.
So, I added four buttons and four LEDs on my breadboard, and then I drew the schematic. After that, I just had to work on the code, which turned out to be easier than I expected.

Here is my schematic:

After, I had my schematic and my physical components ready, the concept of the puzzle just came thorugh while I was playing around with the code.
So, for the code I was a bit out of it the first time I started constructing it. It was as though I had forgotten literally everything about coding. I started using only "if" statements and getting frusterated at why they weren't working the way I wanted them to.
Then, thank god, I realized that I had more options to use for this code like the "for loop". So, then the puzzle or game was complete :)


This is the Rainbow puzzle. And, the goal is to turn on the blinking rainbow effect. But, to do so you would need to turn on the LEDs according to the colors of the rainbow. Red, then yellow, then green, and lastly blue. Once, you do that the blinking starts. Also, the color of the button does not correspond to the same colored LED. Each colored button turns on a different colored LED, so you would have to figure out which is which :)


I cannot seem to upload either a video or a gif of the puzzle because the files are too big :(

However here is a picture of the puzzle and how one of the buttons work:

Thank you :)
