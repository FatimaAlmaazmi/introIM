## Artwork

For this assignment, I did not know where to start. I looked at the magazines and I knew I wouldnt be able to make something as good as that.
So, I kept playing around with functions and loops, until I made a shape that resembled a crane's wing. And, from there I guessed a lot of the numbers and placements.
I'm quite happy with the result, it did take me some time to figure out the colors and what to add. But, it was worth it :)


Here is a screenshot of my assignment:
