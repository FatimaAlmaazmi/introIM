## 2nd Arduino Assignment 


For this assignment, I wanted to expirement and learn more about controlling actuators with both analog and digital sensors.

I have two sets of LEDs, one controlled by an analog sensor (Potentiometer), and one controlled by a digital sensor (Button). And, you can switch between both sets by using the slide switch.

A few things I struggled with in this project, is setting up the physical components on the breadboard. I couldn't find a way to put them neatly, and the wires are everywhere. However, I tried to group them to get them out of the way with clips. It works but I need to be more neat with my setups. Not to mention, I did not know how to put in the slide switch and had a couple of short circuits that scared the hell out of me lol.

With the code, I am still struggling with figuring out why some of my functions dont work. I tried putting the blinkModes in functions and use them instead but they didn't work. But when I added them without a function they worked. I'm not sure why this happens :(

Its a really simple code, but I wanted to make something that would help me better understand these sensors :)


Here is my schematic:
