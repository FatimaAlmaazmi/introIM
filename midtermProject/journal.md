## My midterm Project

This is my midterm project journal :)

### DAY1 (17/Oct/2020)


For my midterm project I am planning on making a game based on the duck from my previous assignment. The game would be about the duck and its journey home to the pond. You will control the duck and take it home, while avoiding annoying clicks along the way.

For today, I am planning to draw some of the images that I will be using for my game.


**1) my own small array of images of the duck walking left and right:**

**2) annoying clicks:**

**3) home or pond:**

I convereted all of the images to png with no backgrounds, so that it would be easier to work with them.

### DAY2 (18/Oct/2020)


What I'm planning to do:

- Start with the program.
- At least make the duck move around the screen.
- Figure out how to put an opening screen and an ending screen.

Although I planned to work on it, I didnt get to because of other assignments :'(

### DAY3 (19/Oct/2020)


Today I started with the program. 

I figured out a way to have an opening screen, by making a function that displays it. It took me a while to place everything in its place, but I got there eventually (however, I'm still unstatisfied with how it looks I might make a few changes here and there after).

Here is what it looks like:

I also started experimenting with displaying the game itself. And here is where I encountered a minor problem. 
I have planned to have the annoying clicks to be placed randomly everytime you restart the game or lose. However, the random fucntion is not giving me the type of randomness that I want. I tried using perlin noise, (I havent used it before) but I gave up on it halfway cause it took a lot of my time.


So, after thinking it through. I might have the annoying clicks be in set places rather than random. Because it is too much of a hassle to deal with now, and I feel like this might help me later because I want to essentially map their locations so that when the duck touches them the lose screen will show. (I'm still not sure how I'm going to acheive that but inshallah I'll figure it out).

Here is a screenshot of the game and the clicks:

I also tried to expiremnet with moving the duck. It turned out to be a little tricky. I tried to follow Professor Aaron's stripe program to figure out where to start. However, I dont know how to make the duck appear in a specific location. And, I dont know how to tell processing to go through my small array of images repeatedly when pressing a key. So the duck does not appear on screen and then when I press a key it shows one image moving. 

So, hopefully I will get to figure this out soon :)
