This is my midterm project journal :)

### DAY1 (17/Oct/2020)


For my midterm project I am planning on making a game based on the duck from my previous assignment. The game would be about the duck and its journey home to the pond. You will control the duck and take it home, while avoiding annoying clicks along the way.


For today, I am planning to draw some of the images that I will be using for my game.


1) my own small array of images of the duck walking left and right:

2) annoying clicks:

3) home or pond:

I convereted all of the images to png with no backgrounds, so that it would be easier to work with them.

### DAY2 (18/Oct/2020)


What I'm planning to do:

- Start with the program.
- At least make the duck move around the screen.
- Figure out how to put an opening screen and an ending screen.
