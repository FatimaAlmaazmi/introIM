### My portrait :)


For my portrait I wanted to make it as simple as possible, but I realized it was going to be harder than I thought.

The thing I struggled with the most was getting the leaves in the background. I looked up ways to create polka dot patterns on Processing, but failed miserably, because the code only created a vertical and horizontal pattern along the middle of the canvas. Therefore, I had to re-word my google search to columns and rows on Processing. From there it was really easy to get the pattern I wanted with a few tweaks. Although, I did not understand the code at first, I spent about 15 mins analyzing every line and adding comments to explain it to myself. It seemed pretty easy then, and I'm happy with the result!



Here is a screenshot of my portrait:
