### My Final Project

## Disco Dog


**Concept:**
My final project is a game about a dog wanting to go to the disco to dance. The player has to follow the correct path to the disco, otherwise they would have to start all over again.

Once the player wins, the dog will dance to his favorite song at the disco.


**Stages of the game:**

**Challanges:**

The only challange that I faced while working on this project is trying to make the buzzer play one note once when the player is at a certain location. I had so many assignments due the same week, that I did not have time to work on this project as much as I'd hoped. However, I am happy with how the game works as of now :)
