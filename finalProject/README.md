### My Final Project

## Disco Dog


**Concept:**
My final project is a game about a dog wanting to go to the disco to dance. Hence the name "Disco Dog". It is based off my previous project, but with a game involved. 

The game is quite simple. The player has to follow the correct path to the disco by stepping on the right platforms. If they step on a wrong platform they would have to start over and try again.

Once the player wins, the dog will dance to his favorite song (Take On Me by A-ha) at the disco.



**Stages of the game:**

**Challanges:**

The only challange that I faced while working on this project is trying to make the buzzer play one note once when the player is at a certain location. I had so many assignments due the same week, that I did not have time to work on this project as much as I'd hoped. Therefore, I did not really find a solution for this. But, I felt that it was alright because I usually prefer games that are quiet. 

I am kind of happy with how the game works as of now :)


**Clever Or Difficult Things:**

I tried to make an actual disco for this dog. It did not turn out the way I had hoped or imagined, but I was really happy that I found that small disco ball Christmas ornament at the last minute. 

I also tried to use the things I learned from a class I took with Professor Michael last Spring (Machine Lab) to make the disco. So, it was really nice to revisit that :)


I don't think theres anything difficult with my project it was pretty simple and I wish I had done more :)
