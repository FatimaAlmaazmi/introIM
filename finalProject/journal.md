## My Final Project

This is my final project journal :)

## Day 1 (25/NOV/2020)


For my final project, I want to make a game out of my dancing dog project.

The goal of the game is to get the dog to the disco, so that he can dance. 


**Processing:**

The background will resemble a disco floor. The start position will be at the bottom left, and the end at the top right. The player has to move the dog, while using keypads, to the right path. If the player chooses a wrong path, the game is lost, and they have to start over. 

Every right platform plays a single note from the dog's favorite song. 


**Arduino:**

Servo Motor will move the dog as it did previously. 

The buzzer will start playing the song, when the game is won. 

The buzzer will also play the single notes from the song when player moves on correct platform.

Green LED will light up when player moves on correct platform.

Red LED will light up when player moves on wrong platform.



Here are pictures of how it might look like:

My plan for next time: is to draw the dog so that I can use it on processing, and start with drawing the layout of different phases in the game on my processing code.


I hope it works :)

## Day 2 (30/NOV/2020)


I spent the day working on the images I will be using in my code. I also tried to test the moveDog(); function, which basically moves the dog with the keypads. However, its not going well. The problem is that I have only a two image sprite, and I do not know how to incorprate it into the code correctly. I found one way to do so, but once the dog moves it leaves a trail of itself behind. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I will figure it out inshallah.

Here are the images that I worked on today and will be using:

For tomorrow I am planning to work on the different states of the game. The start screen, game screen, winning screen, and losing screen. And hopefully when I get everything to work and look great, I will start incorperating the Arduino :)
