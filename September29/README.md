## Assignment 3

For this assignment I wanted to use the void Draw(). Again, thinking of creating something on processing is kind of challenging. Therefore, I felt that it would be easier for me if I set a theme.

So, my theme for this assignment was a song that I was listening to recently. The song is called Sad Happy by Circa Waves (Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_8MAhaoyVk) to their song on yt). The song symbolizes the way that I feel most of the time, and I felt that it would be fun if I tried to emulate this feeling on processing.


Something new yet simple I learnt while making this is the **frameRate()** function. We probably discussed this in class, but I found it useful after watching the Perlin Noise video by The Coding Train. Before adding this function, I felt that my artwork was really dangerous to look at. I found it really hard looking at it, because the random colors would generate at such a high rate, and it wasnt functional. I also did not feel like it matched the vibe or theme that I was trying to emulate. Therefore, this function came in very handy :)

I'm really happy with this, because even though it was really easy to code and very simple, it speaks to me somehow :)



Here is a screenshot of what it looks like (I'm sorry I dont know how to upload it in gif format :( ) :
