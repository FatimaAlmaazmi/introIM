## 4th Arduino Assignment

For this assignment, I was really facsinated by the example code we analyzed in class, where we can control an object on processing by using one of the inputs from arduino.

For my simple game I wanted to try that example. However, I could not come up with a great idea for a game in this short time. I opted for making a really really simple game.

In this game, you have to place the daisy on its stem, using the poetntiometer, photoresistor and a button. Once you place the flower correctly, a sound from processing will play to tell you that you have succeeded.

### Challanges

This assignment was more like practice for me, to get used to using the serial port and using both arduino and processing together. So, I mostly tried to emulate what we studied in class.

The only minor challange I faced was a logical one. One of my if() statements had a logical error that I did not see until after a day. So, after I figured that one out the game worked fine.
